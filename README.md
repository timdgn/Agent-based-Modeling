# Agent-based-Modeling

## What is it ?
Agent-based models are computer simulations that are used to investigate the interactions between different elements, such as people, objects, places, and time.

These models are constructed from the bottom up, meaning that individual agents (often people in the field of epidemiology) are given specific attributes. The agents are programmed to behave and interact with each other and their environment in certain ways, and these interactions can lead to emergent effects that may differ from the effects of individual agents.

## Advantages
Agent-based modeling differs from traditional methods, such as regression analysis, in that it allows for the study of complex systems that exhibit non-independence among individuals and feedback loops in causal mechanisms. Unlike traditional methods, agent-based modeling is not limited to observed data and can be used to model counterfactual situations or experiments that may be impossible or unethical to conduct in the real world.

## Limits
However, agent-based modeling has some limitations, such as the difficulty in finding data parameters (such as the reproductive rate for infectious diseases) in the literature and the difficulty in assessing the validity of the model, especially when modeling unobserved associations.

In summary, agent-based modeling is a useful tool for evaluating the impacts of exposures on outcomes, particularly when interrelatedness, reciprocity, and feedback loops are known or suspected to exist or when real-world experiments are not possible.
